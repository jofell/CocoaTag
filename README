In addition to standard Cocoa dependancies, this application requires
 libusb-0.1.4 (not in this repo - install separately)
 libcrypto (comes as part of the os)
 libnfc (currently statically linked and in this repo)
 libfreefare (currently statically linked and in this repo)
 PCSC.framework (Apple's build of http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html which comes as part of the OS)
 
I've left binaries of libnfc and libfreefare in the repo for now and the XCode project links statically to them via a relative path

To build, simply install libusb onto your Mac and then open up the XCode project.

Getting libusb is easiest using homebrew (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)
> brew install libusb-compat
