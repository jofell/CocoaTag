In addition to standard Cocoa dependancies, this application requires
 libusb-0.1.4 (Install separately)
 libcrypto (Comes as part of Mac OS)
 libnfc (Static library included for now)
 libfreefare (Static library included for now)
 libndef (Source code directly in project for now)
 QtCore.framework (Used by libndef, Get at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp)
 PCSC.framework (Apple's build of http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html which comes as part of the OS)
 
To build, simply install libusb onto your Mac and then open up the XCode project.
I found that getting libusb is easiest using homebrew (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) as follows
'brew install libusb-compat'
